This is not a machine learning or data science course! It is about:

* distributed **data parallelism** in Spark.
* extending familiar functional abstractions like functional lists over large clusters.
* Context: analyzing large data sets.

Spark is a functionally oriented framework for large data set processing implemented in Scala.
